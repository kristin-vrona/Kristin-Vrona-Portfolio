# Welcomeâ€‹

My name is Kristin Vrona. I recently earned my Ph.D. in Economics from Northern Illinois University, where I also completed my M.A. in Economics. I specialize in labor economics and applied econometrics, with a research focus that integrates health economics and public policy analysis.

**I am currently on the job market and open to interview opportunities and willing to discuss relocation.**

### Field Background

My field experience includes supporting the effective allocation of $59 million in public funding and driving significant cost-saving initiatives in the private sector through process improvement and strategic analysis.

With over ten years of experience in big data management, I have a passion for extracting and compiling complex datasets, building narratives through data visualization, and applying econometric methods to assess real-world outcomes. My work often bridges the gap between raw data and actionable insight by automating visual reports and incorporating macroeconomic and institution-specific factors into predictive analyses.

I have also conducted secondary research in game theory and strategic behavior and look forward to continuing to develop these skills.


### Outside of Work

In my spare time I train in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, write and perform music, and enjoy taking long walks outdoors.
