My name is Kristin Vrona. I recently graduated with my doctorate in economics from Northern Illinois University, where I also obtained my master's degree in economics previously. 

# I am currently on the job market and available for interviews. I am willing to relocate.

My doctoral degree specializations are labor economics and applied econometrics, which I have combined with health economics and public policy analysis to construct my dissertation. I also have conducted secondary research in strategy & game theory, and look forward to sharpening these skills in the future.  



### Background

I have over 10 years of expereince in big data management, and I quite enjoy data extraction, compilation, and narrative building using data visualizations. I have experience automating data visualization reports and using econometric methods to examine the projected real-life outcome to contrast to the raw data visualizations. I enjoy bringing clarity and consicesness both in terms of what could happen and what is predicted to happen based on previous data as well as macroeconomics and institutional-specific factors.

My field experience includes the effective allocation of $59M in public funding as well as significantly improving cost savings numbers in the private sector. process improvements resulting in major cost savings in the private sector. 


### Interests

In my spare time I train in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, write and perform music, and enjoy taking long nature walks.
